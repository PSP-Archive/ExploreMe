I realised that many dev projects on PSP needed a file explorer, but that most of th time, each dev had to rebuild his own...
So, I jut made one, first in order to use it myself, but, as I had no idea of what to do with it, I decided to release it under GPL, so every ne culd use it, instead of recreating one, which is quite long.

Here are few of the caracteristics of this explorer:
-The menu is kind of cool, as I loved Xflash, I took the same idea (but made the new code from scratch), making a 'rolling' menu... I love it :)
-You can change theme of the homebrew, it's useless, but I like that too, especially the matrix one :)

Apart from that, I guess it's a basic file browser...

All you have to do to use it is inclued the fonctions you want to apply to files, and just call it when cross is pressed ;)
Of course, feel free to modify it, release it, do whatevrr, as long as it is under GPL, and quotes the author's name.

If you can't compile, but still want to check this out, there's the EBOOT.PBP file inside too ;)

Have fun!
